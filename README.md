# Colorectal-Cancer-Grading

The dataset used in this project comprises of 300 non-overlapping images of size greater than 4548×7548 pixels, extracted at 20× magnification. 
Each image is labelled as normal tissue (Grade1), low grade (Grade2) tumours or high grade (Grade3) tumours by expert pathologists.

**Attention-based Multiple-Instance-Learning** approach is used to classify the large images.
